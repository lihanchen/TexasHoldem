A semester-long project for CS307 Software Engineering

We created a locally playable poker game (like windows game) that allows friends to gather and play Texas Hold'em without having physical chips or a deck of cards.
The reason why we chose this project, even though it's not creative or cool since there are many online poker game platforms out there already, is because, as beginners of software engineering, we will be challenged more in terms of software designing unlike other project topics that are more challenging in terms of having to learn a new language/platform or some specific knowledge for the topic.
